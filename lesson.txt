switch (variable|boolean-expression|Integer type){  
case boolean-expression | integer type  
     Block of code contains statements  
case boolean-expression | integer type  
     Block of code contains statements  
default: // default  case and it is optional  
   Block of code contains statements  
}

REFERENCE TYPES VS VALUE TYPES
------------------------------
you cannot compare reference types of the same type, you can compare value types of the same types
