make(T, n)       slice      slice of type T with length n and capacity n
make(T, n, m)    slice      slice of type T with length n and capacity m

make(T)          map        map of type T
make(T, n)       map        map of type T with initial space for approximately n elements

make(T)          channel    unbuffered channel of type T
make(T, n)       channel    buffered channel of type T, buffer size n

When you set a slice to be nil,the length and capacity becomes zero
When you dont intialize the length and capacity of a slice, it is defaultly nil - index out of range error
